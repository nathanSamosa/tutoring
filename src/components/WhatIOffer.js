                    We will discuss via mobile, email or Zoom the student's age, learning level/year and their
                    goal for tutoring. We will guage their general understanding and see how it compares to
                    what is expected from the school curriculum, and highlight topics that the student knows
                    they would like to improve in first.

                    I will discuss with the student their experiences with Maths in school, and how confident they
                    are in their own ability. We will talk about the school's expectations of them and develop a plan
                    and direction to achieve their goals. We will cover different methods of learning to figure out
                    what suits the student the best, and begin working on the concepts they struggle with the most.

                                visual and hands-on learning), we aim to develop a sound and well-rounded understanding
